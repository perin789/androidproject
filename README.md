CAMPUS NAVIGATION

Every year more than 20,000 students are enrolled at Cal State LA. There are also numerous visitors, guest lecturers, visiting faculty and others that set foot on our campus. 

They all need help finding their way around Cal State LA expansive campus network. 

Navigating an unfamiliar campus can be intimidating, not to mention stress-inducing when you lose your way and risk showing up late for a lecture or an exam.

Our purpose is to build an app that guides the user to their desired location or a building, by giving them turn-by-turn direction from within the campus.
